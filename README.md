This is a simple calculator I created to learn the basics of the JAVA language.

The findTheDistance App receives 4 parameters and calculates the distance between 2 points formed by the first and last parameters like it is shown below:

findTheDistance(param1, param2, param3, param4);
point1 = (param1, param2);
point2 = (param3, param4);

The user will be asked to give the 4 values and the calculator will do th computations.
